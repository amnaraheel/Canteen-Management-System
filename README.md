# Canteen-Management-System

Our project is based on canteen management system and the main objective of this project is to provide fast and easy service to the customers. This project will also allow the user to manage the food items, its sale, and the orders received and executed in a very systematic manner.

## Methodology-/-Plan-development-to-solve-the-Problem
We applied the knowledge we gained in object-oriented programming so far. The main four modules of this management system are:
-	Login Module.
-	Store Module.
-	Employee Module.
-	Billing Module.
 All these modules are able to add, edit, update, access, and delete items and different details according to their requirement. The details of food, their quantities, employee details etc. are handled by filed handling. 

## Specifications
The specifications of our project are as follows:
-	We used global variables for easy access and to avoid the difficulty of defining the same variable again and again.
-	We used four different classes i.e., Login, Store, Employee, and Billing classes.
-	We used file handling to handle the data such as employee record, food items price and their quantities in the canteen, sales made to the customer etc.
-	We used switch cases to provide menu options.

## Essentials to run the code
- Cpp compiler
- Basic knowledge about Cpp and Object-Oriented Programming
